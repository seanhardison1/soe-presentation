## Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management

* Integrated management of a **single-sector** (i.e. fisheries)
* Considers trade-offs of management strategies on ecosystem components<sup>2</sup>

Under EBM, the idea is that these "sectors" must be managed in an integrated fashion, where impacts of each sector on the ecosystem can be assessed and managed with respect to objectives

*The IEA Loop*

???
Before jumping in I'm going to start with some definitions of terms that you'll be hearing a lot of. The first is Integrated Ecosystem Assessmentor (IEA).

IEA is defined as a framework for the synthesis and analysis of relevant natural, social, and economic factors that are relevant to established management objectives.

IEA has been embraced on a nationwide scale by NOAA fisheries, and is a method for moving towards Ecosystem-Based Management for natural resources. 

It's an iterative process, hence, "the loop", and starts with the establishment of management goals by fishery management councils. 

Once objectives are defined, we develop indicators that allow us to quantify and report on the status and trends of ecosystem processes. 

Next we work with management bodies to identify sources of risk in ecosystems that threaten the achievement of management goals, and then we use modeling techniques to evaluate how certain management strategies could propagate through the system. 

Today I'm going to be talking to you about the ecosystem reporting phase of this process.

## Ecosystem Status Reporting (ESR)

Ecosystem reporting provides a route for ecosystem information to enter the stock assessment process

* Well-developed example is AFSC; whose ESRs have long served as context for North Pacific FMC quota 
deliberations<sup>1</sup>

All IEA regions in the US develop similar documents in varying guises

## Classes of ecosystem information

```

## Goals of ESR:

* Identify changes in ecosystem component status (short-term) and trend (long-term)

* Identify potential for changes to affect management concerns

* Highlight "red flags" and potential ecosystem state changes

## ESRs in the Northeast US: Relevance to management

**Why should managers care about an ecosystem perspective to resource management?**

--

Well-informed management decisions rely upon knowledge of the ecosystem being managed

--

An ecosystem perspective is important for managing in the face of rapid, unprecedented ecosystem changes

## ESRs in the Northeast US: Relevance to management

Ecosystem conditions affect fisheries yield 

By providing ESRs to managers, we continue to move towards Ecosystem-based Management strategies to meet sustainability and conservationist goals laid out by the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

* Marine ecosystems in high productivity states may be more resilient to extractive pressures and climate change than those in lower productivity states.
  - EBFM is a way to meet ecosystem objectives while remaining sustainable 






---

## ESR in the Northeast US

ESRs developed by NEFSC since 2009

Considerable support for EAFM exists in Northeast
* Most FMC council members in the Northeast support transitioning from a single-species to a multi-species ecosystem approach (i.e. EBFM) to management<sup>1</sup>

--

Common refrain upon recieving ESR:
# "So what"?

## Problems with ESR model:

* Council members are busy people!

  * Long-documents with unfamiliar information unlikely to connect
  
* Not all Council members have science background

* "What does chlorophyll concentration tell us about fisheries yields?"

The disconnect inspired a new model, which we call **State of the Ecosystem (SOE)** reports

---

## SOE Reporting: Ecosystem science for busy people

Addressing critiques to ESR model in SOE

1. Clear alignment of ecosystem components with management objectives

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Non-technical text

1. Short (< 30 pages), but rigorous

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 

```{r nes-comp2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nes-components-abstracted.png")
```

???
In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model

---
So I'd like to now present the results of this year's State of the Ecosystem reports

# SOE Report: Mid-Atlantic Bight



---
# SOE Report: New England

---

## SOE reporting: quantifying change

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators**

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context<sup>1-3</sup>

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change
