## Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management

* Integrated management of a **single-sector** (i.e. fisheries)
* Considers trade-offs of management strategies on ecosystem components<sup>2</sup>



```{r ebfm-single-sector, fig.align="center", out.width = "50%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ebfm-single-sector.png")
```

???
Under EBM, the idea is that these "sectors" must be managed in an integrated fashion, where impacts of each sector on the ecosystem can be assessed and managed with respect to objectives

Ecosystem-based fishery management, or EBFM, is an integrated management of a single sector by considering how fishery management strategies would affect ecosystem components, or the building blocks of the ecosystem, as a way to maximize ecosystem yield sustainably.

*The IEA Loop*

???
Before jumping in I'm going to start with some definitions of terms that you'll be hearing a lot of. The first is Integrated Ecosystem Assessmentor (IEA).

IEA is defined as a framework for the synthesis and analysis of relevant natural, social, and economic factors that are relevant to established management objectives.

IEA has been embraced on a nationwide scale by NOAA fisheries, and is a method for moving towards Ecosystem-Based Management for natural resources. 

It's an iterative process, hence, "the loop", and starts with the establishment of management goals by fishery management councils. 

Once objectives are defined, we develop indicators that allow us to quantify and report on the status and trends of ecosystem processes. 

Next we work with management bodies to identify sources of risk in ecosystems that threaten the achievement of management goals, and then we use modeling techniques to evaluate how certain management strategies could propagate through the system. 

Today I'm going to be talking to you about the ecosystem reporting phase of this process.

## Ecosystem Status Reporting (ESR)

Ecosystem reporting provides a route for ecosystem information to enter the stock assessment process

* Well-developed example is AFSC; whose ESRs have long served as context for North Pacific FMC quota 
deliberations<sup>1</sup>

All IEA regions in the US develop similar documents in varying guises

## Goals of ESR:

* Identify changes in ecosystem component status (short-term) and trend (long-term)

* Identify potential for changes to affect management concerns

* Highlight "red flags" and potential ecosystem state changes

![SOE-Network-Diagram](images/SOE_Network_Diagram.png)

???
This network diagram provides an example of how primary production and environmental drivers are linked to a pelagic fishery and protected species.  

With SOEs, we want to describe these linkages and explain why they're important to managers. 

Nested within the pelagic fishery node in this diagram are the societal benefits derived from that fishery, linking social and economic ecosystem components to the base of the food web and environment.

## ESRs in the Northeast US: Relevance to management

**Why should managers care about an ecosystem perspective to resource management?**

--

Well-informed management decisions rely upon knowledge of the ecosystem being managed

--

An ecosystem perspective is important for managing in the face of rapid, unprecedented ecosystem changes

## ESRs in the Northeast US: Relevance to management

Fisheries yields are affected by ecosystem conditions<sup>1-3</sup>

Important ecosystem predictors of fisheries yield on global scale<sup>1</sup>:
* Sea surface temperature (-)
* Chlorophyll <i>a</i> (+)
* Particle export ratio (particles leaving euphotic zone:primary production) (+)
* Mesozooplankton productivity (+)

The figure here shows the relationship between chlorophyll a production in 52 large marine ecosystems around the world with fisheries yield in those systems. So we know that these relationships exist, but drawing actionable place-based management advice from this information is difficult, but in the works here at the Center.

## ESR in the Northeast US

ESRs developed by NEFSC since 2009

Considerable support for EAFM exists in Northeast
* Most FMC council members in the Northeast support transitioning from a single-species to a multi-species ecosystem approach (i.e. EBFM) to management<sup>1</sup>

--

Common refrain upon recieving ESR:
# "So what"?

---

## Problems with ESR model:

* Council members are busy people!

  * Long-documents with unfamiliar information unlikely to connect
  
* Not all Council members have science background

* "What does chlorophyll concentration tell us about fisheries yields?"

The disconnect inspired a new model, which we call **State of the Ecosystem (SOE)** reports

![soe-snippet](images/soe-snippet.png)

## SOE Reporting: Ecosystem science for busy people

Addressing critiques to ESR model in SOE

1. Clear alignment of ecosystem components with management objectives

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Non-technical text

1. Short (< 30 pages), but rigorous

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 

```{r nes-comp2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nes-components-abstracted.png")
```

???
In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model


---
## SOE reporting: Quantifying change

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators**

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context<sup>1-3</sup>

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

## SOE 2019: Human dimensions
**Recrational fishing**
NE: 
* While commercial fisheries have high specialization of catch, there is a positive long-term trend for diversity of catch in New England rec fisheries
* Marine Recreational Information Program data shows that there's been an increase in recreational seafood harvest in New England since the mid-90s, with an overall decline since the mid-80s
* This corresponds with an increase in recreational effort since the mid 90s

MAB:
* Similar to NE, there's been an increase in rec seafood harvest and recreational effort since the mid-90s
* An opposite trend in recreational fleet effort, due to a contraction in the number of party and charter boats long-term
*Decrease in catch diversity, opposite of New England, requires further exploration

---
## SOE 2019: Human dimensions
**Recreational engagement and reliance**
Similar to the commercial engagement and reliance, many communities on east coast are dependent on recreational fisheries.

A downward trend in recreational catch diversity may threaten the stability of these communities in the face of species range shifts and climate change

New England communities will likely benefit from a positive trend in catch diversity

## SOE 2019: Protected species

## SOE 2019: Protected species
**North Atlantic right whales (NARW)**
* Among most endangered large whales in the world
* Strong evidence suggests that the level of interaction between NARWs, lobster gear (US), and snow crab gear (CAN) is contributing to the decline of the species
* While populations increased steadily between 1990-2011, it has decreased recently. 
* 20 NARW deaths in 2017 and 2018, >50% due to human interactions

---
## SOE 2019: Protected species
**North Atlantic right whales (NARW)**

* Current bycatch levels suggest that management actions have been effective in reducing harbor porpoise bycatch
* 2016 and 2017 estimates are among the lowest in the time series. 
* POtential biological removal - The maximum number of animals that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach a stable population size

## SOE 2019: Protected Species
**Common tern**
* Common tern breeding colonies are monitored in the southern GOM
* Common tern sensitive to vertical distribution of prey
* Warmer waters have in the past resulted in an increase in butterfish prevalence in diet
* Butterfish are difficult to ingest and smallow, and may cause starvation or require parents to increase foraging effort
* High diet diversity in past decade may be the result of decreases in preferred prey type (herring, sandlance)

## SOE 2019: Fish and invertebrates
*Objective: Keep harvested species within population ranges where productivity is maximized over long-term

Stocks depicted here represent a subset of the full ecosystem

Plot shows the ratio of stock mortality (F) to stock mortality at maximum sustainable yield, where a number larger than one indicates the stock is experiencing unsustainable fishing pressure. On the x axis we have the ratio of estimated stock biomass to biomass at maximum sustainable yield. 

NE:
* 4 stocks above F/Fmsy and below B/Bmsy
  * Southern NE Yellowtail
  * GOM Cod
  * CC-GOM Yellowtail
  * Southern GB/MAB red hake

MAB:
* No stock above F/Fmsy and below B/Bmsy
* Mackerel currently seeing unsustainable fishing mortality

**Changing distributions**
Management based around stable species distributions
Shifting ecosystem conditions resulting from climate change and historic fishing pressure are changing species distributions

The NEFSC has run a bottom trawl survey since the early 1960s, and the data highlights how the representative species in the survey have shifted in composition during that period.

Plot of NEFMC species in MAB, Plot of MAFMC species in NE

*Increase in MAFMC species in GOM/GB driven by mackerel
*Decline in NEFMC species in MAB driven mostly by ocean pout, although ocean pout appears to be declining in all bottom trawl surveys

**Bottom trawl surveys**
NE:
* In Gulf of Maine, the survey data show long-term increases in the Fall survey for Piscivores, Planktivores, and Benthos species, and long-term increases in planktivore abundance in the spring. 
* In Georges Bank, the survey shows long-term increases for benthos and planktivore species in both fall and spring, and piscivores in the fall.
* A recent decline in Georges Bank benthivore biomass is driven by a decline in haddock in the survey

**Bottom trawl surveys**
MA:
Here we show the NEFSC bottom trawl survey data paired with inshore bottom trawl data from the Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (or NEAMAP) survey, in red, performed annually by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.

Of note here are the opposing trends in piscivore biomass during the spring and fall seasons for the offshore survey. Further, Piscivores in the spring inshore survey appear to be in decline in recent years.This pattern may be due to inshore vs offshore distributions of spiny dogfish.

The patterns in offshore and inshore survey data appear to be similar, and further work in the coming year will explore the factors driving their similarities and differences (e.g. importance of nearshore habitats)

**Fish condition**

* Fish condition is measured at the weight at a given length relative to the average
  * Condition, or "fatness", is a factor that influences fecundity
  
NE:
* Looking at condition in aggregate across NEFMC managed stocks, we can see a clear decline in condition between 2000-2010
* Recent improvement within past decade

MAB:
* A similar pattern was seen in the MAB

* Interestingly, the drop-off in condition around 2000 resembles a shift in zooplankton size-structure on the shelf, and this is a topic for future research

## SOE 2019: Fish and invertebrates
**Fish productivity**
The fish productivity indicator shown here is the small fish per large fish biomass anomaly 

MAB: The fish productivity indicator shows that productivity has been low in the region since 2010, but recent strong productivity years in witch flounder, silver hake, and winter flounder have driven increases.

## SOE 2019: Fish and invertebrates
**Larval diversity**
The last thing I'll talk about from the fish and intertebrates section is our metric of larval diversity, which was derived from the NEFSC Ecosystem Monitoring cruises. 

The diversity index tells us about the changing dominance of forage fish, hake, and haddock in the plankton

The most recent data we have for the Mid-Atlantic has shown the lowest larval estimates of larval diversity in the time series. As temperatures increase, there is a potential for a temporal mismatch of larvae with their zooplankton food sources, which could affect larval survival.

---
## SOE 2019: Habitat quality and ecosystem productivity
Indicators here provide information about changing conditions encountered by managed species in different seasons and across habitats, which likely influences their distributions

First indicator I'd like to talk about is habitat quality in Chesapeake Bay, which many resource species use as nursery habitat or are considered estuarine dependent (e.g. bluefish, striped bass, menhaden, black sea bass)

These data, which were provided by collaborators at the Chesapeake Bay Program, represent the percent of tidal waters in Chesapeake Bay meeting water quality standards for chlorophyll a, submerged aquatic vegetation, and dissolved oxygen. The increase in water quality for the Bay has been tied to management action limiting nutrient flux into the watershed.

Ocean temperature ("it's warm and getting warmer")
Both surface and bottom temperature in NE are increasing
*Gulf of Maine summer SSTs were the highest on record

## SOE 2019: Habitat quality and ecosystem productivity
Ocean temperature ("it's warm and getting warmer")
The same is true for the Mid-Atlantic Bight
* Mid-Atlantic summer SSTs were 3rd highest on record

Ocean circulation

Which brings us back to...

GSI

Like I said earlier, the Gulf Stream Index measures the position of the Northern edge of the Gulf Stream. As it's advanced northwards, it warms ocean waters and affects the proportion of Warm Slope Water entering Gulf of Maine. 

slopewater proportions in the NE Channel

The proportion of slope water derived from the warm slope water at 200 m depth is at an all time high, and the implications of this are not fully understood

## SOE 2019: Habitat quality and ecosystem productivity
Primary production
* Summer PP is increasing in both New England and Mid-Atlantic


* Driven by warmer temperatures and increased bacterial remineralization and nutrient recycling
* Increasing primary production likely due to higher productivity of smaller phytoplankton

---
## SOE 2019: Habitat quality and ecosystem productivity
Primary production and zooplankton
To assess the size structure of copepods in the region, we use the small-large index.
* A measure of relative size composition of the dominant copepod taxa
* A lower value means higher abundance of large copepods (<i>Calanus</i>)
* Primary production may play a role in copepod size dynamics***


---

## SOE 2019: Habitat quality and ecosystem productivity
Zooplankton abundance
<i>Calanus finmarchicus</i> is an important prey species for NARW and larval fish on the NE Shelf
* In GOM and GB, relatively high abundance of the small-bodied copepod <i>Centropages typicus</i> correspond with periods of high fish conditions in the region
* There is a negative trend in the small-bodied <i>Pseudocalanus</i> species on Georges Bank and in the Mid-Atlantic 

* In MAB, we also provide information on seasonal abundances of key zooplankton species
  * Of note are the opposing trends in <i>Centropages</i> in spring and fall, which corresponds to a shift in timing of their peak concentration from late fall to early spring<sup>1</sup>
